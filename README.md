Hi:
If you find /api/patient and /api/medication not working When you unzip this file and open it in visual studio, 
1. select "show All file" button in "Solution Expoler"
2. open folder named "controllers", find "patientcontroller.cs" and "medicationcontroller.cs" and right click them, select "include in project"
3. open folder named "models", include all files and folder to project
